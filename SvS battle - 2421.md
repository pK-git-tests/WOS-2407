## SVS RULES - nobody really know because ROK is to busy being cowards and this is agreed with other alliances

1. Attacks on all cities are prohibited during the battle and around the castle are prohibited for an hour before and 30 minutes after the battle (the one hour peace time before and 30 minutes after only apply near the castle)

2. State 2326 is allocated the North & West sides of the castle, and State 2407 is allocated the East & South sides of the castle for the battle.
3. Be prepared for ROK not to follow these rules

## SVS BATTLE
### Predispositions:
- Ability to read this message
- Ability to read alliance notices + labels

### Introduction
- For several svs battles we have been fighting together as one state and all active players are going to MAX alliance --> our only goal is to hold the castle until WE SAY otherwise, so no one will do rallies on turrets or the castle.
- While waiting for rallies, feel free to do solo attacks to get points but as soon as there are rallies, fill them.

> [!TIP]
> Please keep the correct troops ratio (it will be on the label above the castle). **Priority for the castle garrison and the main rallies** (pK (simba) and Vild (pumba)) is given to `players with helios units and FC5 units.`
> - For joining attack use **5-star Reina or Jessie** as your lead hero
> - For reinforcment use **Patrick** as your lead hero
> - Switch heroes when you get into the castle

### Strategy
- At the beginning everyone will send a solo attack on the castle with speedups to get the first castle hold.

Then we have 2 strategies.
1. What we always do - pk, Vild + Nico/Matt/Natsu will start a triple rally and we will see if pK + vild will be strong enough to always kick out zozo with double rallies.
   The second one will then be composed of about 6 or more rally leaders, to test how many people will be needed for him (Matt, Nico, Natsu, Vander, Jester, Be Gentle etc.)

Then we move on to second strategy:

2. Coutner rallies
- When we kick him out of the castle, pk will be in garrison and Vild + Nico/Matt/Natsu will go to WTF together with a few players to fill the double rally.
- The moment ZOZO makes a rally on me, Vild + friend will make a double rally so that it arrives e.g. 3 seconds after ZOZO, he should be sufficiently weakened after the attack and the double rally should get him out.
- When he starts rallying on WTF, pK + friend will start a double rally to kick him out again 3 seconds after he takes the castle.

PS: They don't have anyone else who would be able to kick us out of the castle, so it can be boring at times, but until we get at least a 30-minute lead in holding the castle, please everyone focus on the castle and leave personal points for later.

PSS: It is possible that ZOZO will start attacking people around the castle, please use shield.

Thanks everyone and good luck tomorrow.

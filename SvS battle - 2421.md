## SVS RULES - nobody really know because ROK is to busy being cowards and this is agreed with other alliances
Attacks are prohibited in the red and gray zones from 12:00 UTC to 17:30 UTC.
No city attacks are permitted during castle time.

## SVS BATTLE
### Predispositions:
- Ability to read this message
- Ability to read alliance notices + labels

### Introduction
- For several svs battles we have been fighting together as one state and all active players are going to MAX alliance --> our only goal is to hold the castle until WE SAY otherwise, so no one will do rallies on turrets or the castle.
- While waiting for rallies, feel free to do solo attacks to get points but as soon as there are rallies, fill them. WHEN THEY ARE DOING RALLIES ON US REINFORCE CASTLE!

> [!TIP]
> Please keep the correct troops ratio (it will be on the label above the castle). **Priority for the castle garrison and the main rallies** (pK (HarryPika) and Vild (pumba)) is given to `players with helios units and FC5 units.`
> - For joining attack use **5-star Reina or Jessie** as your lead hero
> - For reinforcment use **Patrick** as your lead hero
> - Switch heroes when you get into the castle and there is enough time before their rallies
> - If their rallies will hit us a few seconds after retaking castle then we will use Phily as a joiner.



### Strategy for everyone
- At the beginning everyone will send a solo attack on the castle with speedups to get the first castle hold --> everyone even rally joiners with speedups.


## Strategy for rally joiners
- Preset your lines with 1 attacking squad, 1 deffensive squad and 1 squad with Philly in case we will use her.
- Active pets and if you can activate your city buffs (10% and if you can spare then even 20% for deployment capacity)
- When there are no rallies from our side and there is enough time before their rallies arrive then you can do solo on turrets but in other cases please wait for rallies or reinforcement. Winning as a state is more important than personal score!
- When you see their double or triple rallies try to time your reinforcement for castle to arrive at the same time as the rallies (if there is a gap then try to fit among that gap) --> everyone can send reinforcement against double rallies. (45% will arrive too soon, 45% will arrive too late but if we can make that 10% to fit garrison then it could make the biggest difference in the battle. FOR THIS REINFORCMENET SEND 2-3 SQUAD AT ONCE so 1 should hit the sweet spot.
- The above mentioned reinforcement tactic will be healing-intensive, so if you run out of resources or can't heal fast enough, take a break and let someone else do the reinforcement.
- When PK is holding castle and there is enough time before enemies then FC7 troops or helios are preferred. Please do not send FC5 or FC6 to the castle until we fill it with FC7, we need the strongest garrison possible. R4 will kick you out and if you keep sending troops despite the warning, we will kick you out of MAX because we cannot afford mistakes.

## Strategy for rally leaders
- Each rally leader will be part of the SVS chat, where after the battle starts they will send me their time and how long it takes them to get to the castle.
- We will divide into several teams
1) pK (pets ON) + someone from fun as backup in case pK wont be strong enough
2) Fishy (pets OFF) + Natsu (pets ON) + someone from FUN as backup
3) Vild (pets ON) + Felix (pets OFF) + Jkidz/Jester
4) Nico(pets ON) + Matt (pets OFF) + 2 other players as backup because Matt will be missing first hour (Jkidz/Jester/Gentle)

- Each team will start by dividing it by 1 minute between their rallies, because the other state will do counter rallies, so we have to do our rallies as much as necessary and over time we will see the teams depending on how strong the opponent is.
- We will turn on pet buffs gradually to spread them out during the battle.

- pK or someone will post the times when you are supposed to start your rallies, it will look like this
Team 2: Target - Castle - 5min
Arrival time: 12:12:00
Fishy – 21:28:41
Felix – 12:06:15
Natsu – 12:06:26
- This time means the time when you have already prepared your squad and you click on this fancy "DEPLOY" button
